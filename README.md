***COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations Analysis Project***

**Overview**

This SQL project involves an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data, focusing on deaths and vaccinations. The project uses a series of SQL queries to extract, clean, and analyze data to uncover key insights about the impact of the pandemic across different countries. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how vaccination efforts correlate with death rates and how different regions have been affected over time. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, perform complex queries, and derive meaningful insights using SQL.

**Project Workflow and Query Summary**

**1. Data Extraction:**

**SELECT Queries:**

Extracted specific columns from the COVID-19 dataset, including country names, total cases, total deaths, total vaccinations, and population. These queries formed the foundation for the subsequent analysis, ensuring that only relevant data was pulled from the database.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

**WHERE Clause with Conditions:**

Filtered out countries with missing or incomplete data to ensure accuracy in the analysis. This step was crucial in maintaining data integrity.

**COALESCE Function:**

Used to replace NULL values in numerical columns (e.g., total deaths, total vaccinations) with zeros or other default values, preventing errors in calculations and visualizations.

**GROUP BY and Aggregation:**

Grouped data by country and date to calculate aggregate metrics such as the sum of vaccinations, total deaths, and cases. This allowed for a clearer view of the pandemic's progression over time.

**2. Data Analysis:**

**JOIN Operations:**

Utilized different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine multiple tables containing COVID-19 statistics, vaccination data, and population metrics. This enabled a comprehensive analysis of how vaccination efforts correlate with mortality rates.

**Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions):**

Implemented subqueries and CTEs to break down complex calculations into manageable steps. These techniques were used to calculate cumulative deaths, vaccination rates per 100,000 people, and other derived metrics.

**Window Functions:**

Applied window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and RANK() to analyze trends over time and rank countries based on vaccination rates and death counts. This provided insights into which countries were most affected and how vaccination efforts impacted death rates.

**3. Advanced Calculations:**

**CASE Statements:**

Used CASE statements to create new categories based on vaccination levels and death rates, allowing for more nuanced analysis. For example, countries were categorized as "Low," "Medium," or "High" based on their vaccination rates.

**Percentage Calculations:**

Calculated the percentage of the population vaccinated and the mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 people) to standardize the data and make it comparable across countries with varying population sizes.

**4. Trend Analysis:**

**DATE Functions:**
Utilized date functions to analyze data over time, identifying trends in COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. This included calculating the daily, weekly, and monthly increase in vaccination rates and deaths.
**Rolling Averages:**
Calculated rolling averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in the data, particularly in relation to vaccination rollouts and their impact on death rates.

**Key Features**

**Comprehensive Data Analysis:**
Demonstrates proficiency in SQL for extracting, cleaning, and transforming large datasets to perform in-depth analysis.

**Advanced Query Techniques:**
Utilizes advanced SQL techniques such as JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions to analyze complex relationships within the data.

**Insightful Metrics:**
Calculates critical metrics such as vaccination rates per capita, mortality rates, and percentage changes over time, providing valuable insights into the global response to the pandemic.

**Trend Identification:**
Highlights trends in COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations using time-based analyses and rolling averages, offering a clear view of how different regions have been impacted.

**Conclusion**

This project showcases my expertise in SQL, particularly in handling complex datasets and performing advanced queries to derive actionable insights. The analysis of COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations provides a detailed understanding of how the pandemic has affected different countries and how vaccination efforts have played a role in mitigating its impact. This project is an excellent demonstration of my ability to contribute to data-driven decision-making processes in any analytical role.
